    <h3>Challenge 1 - Technical </h3>
    <p>Complete the following problem using whatever coding language you know best. Scores will be evaluated on functionality, accessibility, and efficiency.
</p>
<p> Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1

    <h3>Challenge 2 - Technical </h3>
    <p>Complete the following problem using whatever coding language you know best. Scores will be evaluated on functionality, accessibility, and efficiency.
</p>
<p> You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.
Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Example 1:
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Total profit is 4 + 3 = 7.


Example 2:
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Total profit is 4.


Example 3:
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no way to make a positive profit, so we never buy the stock to achieve the maximum profit of 0.

    <h3>Challenge 3 - Creative </h3>
    <p>Create an interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a topic of your choice. The thematic elements, color scheme, website design, layout, and user experience should reflect the theme and aesthetic of the topic. Scores will be evaluated on functionality, accessibility, efficiency, and creativity.
